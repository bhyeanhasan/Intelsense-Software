                                We operate the website https://www.intelsense.ai/ (the "Site"),
                                as well as any other related products and services that refer or
                                link to these legal terms (the "Legal Terms") (collectively, the
                                "Services"). Intelsense Al started as a plan to bridge the gap
                                of inconsistent and asymmetric access to linguistic tools across
                                the world. Starting from education to job fields, all sorts of
                                speech-based technologies are available in English only or
                                mostly which deprives the majority of the native population in
                                every country. After 4 years, Intelsense has grown into a
                                company with more than 30 employees, everyone working to develop
                                a more inclusive world where language is not a barrier for using
                                Al technologies. Our brainstorming started with simple speech
                                tools like assistants and chatbots, then we started to recognize
                                the efficiency needs of different industries and strived to
                                create innovative concepts to solve their problems. You can
