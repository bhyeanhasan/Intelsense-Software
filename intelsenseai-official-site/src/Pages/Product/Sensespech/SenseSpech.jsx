                The traditional onboarding or sign-up process is very tedious to say the least. It requires you to attentively type all the information that have been requested in the form. Any mistake may lead you to an even more frustrating user journey. The more you have to be cautious, the more it feels like a stressor. And if this is something you need to do in a rush, with a fragile health or upset mood, it flagrantly adds up to the frustration. Good news is, this user pain point is soon to be over. And the benefits are not going to be limited to English speaking users.
