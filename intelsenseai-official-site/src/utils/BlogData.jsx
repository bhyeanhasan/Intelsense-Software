      "Introducing Sense Voice, an AI-driven Voice Assistant to transform your digital shopping experience",
    content: `<h4>What is Voice Commerce</h4>
        <p>
          Ever wondered about getting instant answers in the form of
          “speech” rather than typing? Well, it is no longer a mystery,
          rather a reality nowadays . Voice Commerce refers to the use of
          voice based solutions to search and purchase products from an
          e-commerce platform. This is like talking to the website. Customer
          needs to voice out which product or service he is looking for, the
          platform will seamlessly execute this command through ‘Artificial
          Intelligence’ and ‘Natural Language Processing’ technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Voice commerce is indeed a new age of e-commerce. Conversational
          AI simplifies any task for the e-commerce customers. Online
          retailers can now allow their customers to look for items, place
          the order, make payment as per preference, track the order status
          and provide post delivery feedback. Furthermore, these command
          histories can be used to make future orders.
        </p>
        <h4>How Voice Commerce helps E-Commerce Brands:</h4>
        <p>
          One of the biggest challenges in e-commerce is that the potential
          customers are dropping off before executing a purchase. The most
          common reasons are either because the customers are unable to
          decide which products to buy or simply they fail to execute the
          research. This is exactly where voice commerce comes to play.
          There are so many alternatives in the market nowadays that almost
          everyone seems to be in a quandary to select which one to
          purchase. With Voice Commerce, people can just utter the product
          they are looking for; for example “what are the best mobile covers
          under 500 bdt”. The intelligent voice assistant will instantly
          scan all relevant data to find you the best possible cover and
          alternatives. This not only smoothens the user experience, but
          also streamlines the operation for the e-commerce as they no
          longer are required to invest extra resources in this. Basically,
          voice commerce is the language of the customer's choice.
        </p>
        <h4>Trends & Use Cases of Voice Commerce: </h4>
        <p>
          Voice Commerce is indeed a game changer for the industry.
          Researchers predict that by 2022, voice based shopping will
          penetrate about 55% of all American households, hitting about 40
          billion dollars by that time. This platform will be a pivotal part
          of the user experience strategy. Following are the list of trends
          and uses of voice commerce-
          <ol>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">
                Personalized shopping experience:
              </span>
              voice commerce will personalize the shopping experiences with
              the use of recommendations based on individual preferences.
              Suppose, a customer is exploring Daraz to buy electronic
              appliances for households. The voice assistant in the platform
              can better suggest the trending electronics that are hitting
              the market. It will help the customer with better informed
              decision making and enable repetitive buying.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Suggest better reviews: </span>
              Another major advantage of using voice commerce is that it has
              the power to suggest better customer recommendations and
              reviews. The ease and convenience of reviewing products make
              them more meaningful and genuine. Voice assistants certainly
              reduce the task of typing long feedbacks. It rather asks for
              very specific queries and meaningful answers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Time efficient: </span> Research
              claimed that about 62% of the respondents would use a voice
              assistant while multitasking. Because of its effectiveness and
              responsiveness, people are eager to use voice assistants. The
              average person normally types around 30 to 35 words per
              minute. But if one uses a voice assistant, he/she will be able
              to process about 100 words per minute, resulting in a better
              output. By using voice assistants, people can shop anywhere at
              any time while being engaged in other activities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Smart Shopping: </span> Voice
              assistants will be able to let our shopping experience more
              effectively. It is smart enough to capture our consumer
              behavior and habits. For example, when we are trying to buy
              products online, the voice assistant will remind us about the
              products we have previously missed on the shopping card and
              recommend better products in the market. This is a huge
              competitive advantage for our local premium brands.
            </li>
          </ol>

    title: `How AI is transforming Journalism`,
    content: `
        <p><strong>What’s this about?</strong></p>
<p>A picture of future journalism is moving throughout the world in which it’s being reformed by the advanced concepts of AI-based technology. The idea began flourishing when a survey was conducted in 71 newsrooms from 32 countries by the London School of Economics (LSE). The results depicted a prediction of a wider and more stable impact on the current structure of journalism. The fields are expected to be heavily influenced by AI including data analytics, forecasting, plagiarism detection, fake news detection, NLP and more.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s dive deeper to learn more-</strong></p>
<p>In 2019, ‘The economist’ took an interview with an AI bot. The bot was the GPT-2, a natural language processing model created by OpenAI. In the particular session, the model was able to answer a set of questions regarding the state of the world. One particular question was, ‘What is the future of AI?’ to which GPT-2 responded in this way -</p>
<p>“<em>It would be good if we used the technology more responsibly. In other words, we should treat it like a utility, like a tool. We should put as much effort into developing the technology as necessary, rather than worrying that it’s going to harm us or destroy our lives.”</em></p>
<p>There were comments that the bot did not understand what it was saying but it had a big thought of the future implied. The statement denoted a future of AI technology built in a manner that it almost mirrored human behaviour and performance.</p>
<p><strong>AI uses in journalism</strong></p>
<p>When the talk on the use of AI arises, it certainly doesn’t just mean the programme or technology is just limited to thinking and interacting like a human being. AI is capable of performing activities that are beyond human possibilities or even by completely accurate computers. The branch of journalism has been carefully observed where the implementation of AI not just fits the best, but also establishes new heights in efficiency. These are a few of the examples where various dimensions of AI use is recognised.</p>
<p>Some vital ways have been explained below to provide stronger understanding of using AI technologies that can lead to big differences.</p>
<p><strong>Data analytic and forecasting:&nbsp;</strong>Even with high efficiency, manual observation and analysis of data always save at least a few percent of error possibilities which are unavoidable. The reason is the human brain is naturally unbound to limitations but it has inconsistency in maintaining these capabilities that leads to such unavoidable errors. This is why newsrooms use AI robots for detecting central trends or unusual behaviour from big sets of data. No matter the size of data produced, it is now possible to go through all of it within a comparatively lesser amount of time. This lets them form patterns of events in predictive data analytics that are complicated and time-consuming for normal humans to catch.</p>
<p><strong>Plagiarism check:&nbsp;</strong>When information is nearly always available, most of the news and detail based documents come short of originality and ethics. With the help of largely stored data sets from any field, these bots are able to spot the origin of information easily while data mining, in unethically reproduced articles or transcribed interviews. In journalism, authenticity is a must characteristic for any sort of content to be published or it can deeply scar agencies and careers in the subject for lack of such trait.</p>
<p><strong>Fake news detection:&nbsp;</strong>Since computers are already highly accurate in data management and calculation, adding its own intellect makes it a great way to enhance the authenticity and safety of news media. False news is enough to stand as destruction for a social community in a virtual generation because it directly influences an individual’s process of thought towards the systems and surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>AI tools in Journalism</strong></p>
<p>As the interest and expectations of AI are exponentially increasing through gaming perspectives in highlights, it has been under-eyes how numerous existing and current news media have already implied a number of AI tools to restructure the functions of journalism. There is an insight that the technology is being prepared in a manner that it would take over certain tasks in the industry of press and media. This creates an idea of journalism being prioritized in the future equal to existing industrial sectors.</p>
<p>· <strong>New York Times R&amp;D Lab:&nbsp;</strong>Founded in as early as 2006, the NYT newspaper has been working on emerging technologies to evolve the services of journalism. Such parts of research involve studies focused on photogrammetry, media transmission, computer vision, spatial computing, and misinformation. Among all, misinformation was stated as a rise of threat to society in ‘The Rise of AI-Enabled Disinformation’ due to its strong potential of drastic impact.</p>
<p>· <strong>Washington Post;&nbsp;</strong>One of the Washington post’s new exciting tools is the lead locator. It’s known to provide locations, more specifically appended to political situations for reporters to collect confidential or notable news.</p>
<p>· <strong>Academia</strong>: To support and broaden the striking role of AI in giving journalism a new face, recently established summits, professional discussions, and conferences as Machine + Media, Computation + Journalism have produced significance in AI technology exploration. Lately, WU Dao 2.0 has been exposed at ‘Beijing Academy of Artificial intelligence’ as the world’s currently largest NLP (Natural Processing Language) model and that is 10times larger than GTP-3.</p>
<p><strong>Possibility of anchor replacement by AI?</strong></p>
<p>In the state of China, Xinhua, a news agency along with the Chinese tech firm, Sogou, released the latest version of its AI 3D anchors named ‘Xinn Xiawei’ which was based on a real anchor of the agency. The facial expressions and speech delivering manner almost mimicked the actual anchor using multi-modal recognition and synthesis, facial recognition, animation and transfer learning. As China is only starting the chapter of building more AI Anchors, there is a presumption that such technologies would be taking over the reporting positions in media due to its indistinguishable resemblance to humans in interaction.</p>
<p>Although the use and new ideas of AI have been gaining quite the attention in journalism and other industries, controversial questions have made their way into the board of attention. These questions are, ‘Is this the future we are moving towards?’. If agreed to, “How much would like listening to the news by an artificial anchor? Would you want them to simply read the news void of emotions following strict operations, or would you rather prefer touch with human emotions? The answer varies from person to person, and the scenario of acceptability can have a mass effect on how the upcoming anchors would perform in the days ahead.</p>
<p><strong>AI in Journalism - Saviour or Destroyer?</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of AI in journalism does not illustrate any damage or disruption in the generic functions of the field so far. At the moment, it rather seems to facilitate most hypothetical and practical designs of execution. But it’s up to how the organisations and roles in charge apply the technologies so that it does not overpower the industry of media with robots.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Tow Centre of Digital journalism in a study suggested editorial values be integrated into the system for audiences who receive AI-enabled news. The design would depict a story put together with the help of technology.</p>
<p>In the EU, the Council for Mass Media in Finland asked the Media Council to immediately address the issues of data processing, choices in computerised procedures and transparency or else ‘others’ will jeopardize the press power and freedom.</p>
<p>With more rising pros entering the field of journalism due to AI development, the cons can single-handedly cause devastation in social infrastructure by manipulating information. The faith of the public is more or less always unstable in media-based organisations and slight exposure of technological misuse can ruin it. If the media working with new yet sensitive technologies don’t move ahead cautiously, it will more seemingly take a negative toll.</p>
<p>Will AI come in as a saviour or destroyer for journalism?</p>
<p>That can only be answered in the future where we will experience a bigger and clearer implication, mass responses, and general impacts other than just experimental prototypes.</p>

    <p className="rtejustify">Only if we, humans, could remember all the things we learned in life - if we could retain all the memories since day one, recall solutions to problems, or learn numerous languages!&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">We all wondered about the things we could have accomplished, but only few are persistent enough to turn their wonderful dreams into reality.&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">As a child, Rumman Arefin wanted to build something that learns and becomes smarter than himself with an infinite room for self-improvement. He needed something more than a calculator - something that could solve all the problems he could not find the answers to.</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">With time, the child grew up to become a software professional and began working as a software designer for various national and international organisations. One day, while analysing a bank's chatbot, he was left thinking about why the implementation of technology and artificial intelligence (AI) is not vast in Bangladesh.&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">"Humankind is the self-declared king of this solar system because of our intelligence. But now we are preparing the stage for something that transcends us. We, humans, give souls to the machines by designing software. Now, we can give the intelligence to the machine which makes us the best," said Rumman during an interview with The Business Standard.&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify"><strong>The forming of Intelsense AI</strong></p>
    <p className="rtejustify">AI is a revolutionary technology that is challenging the history of technology itself. If given the power to think, machines can think thousands of times faster than most intelligent people in the world.&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">By blending that childhood curiosity with innovation, Rumman began building a general-purpose AI capable of improving the learning algorithm by itself.&nbsp;</p>
    <p className="rtejustify">He felt the necessity to introduce this particular chapter of AI in Bangladesh and made up his mind to found Intelsense AI in 2018. Over the years, Rumman, along with seven core members, formed a team of 21 that consists of researchers, developers, business development executives, and so on.&nbsp;</p>

    title: `The History And Evolution Of Conversational AI`,
    content: `<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do you remember Jarvis, the highly intelligent Artificial Intelligence (AI) from the Marvel Studios film Iron Man, who could perform all duties just by following Iron Man's vocal commands? Do you wish to communicate with your deceased family members using a gadget that can perfectly replicate them?</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">These things sound so strange, that they only appear to be feasible in sci-fi movies and in a madman's imagination.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Different people might perceive this from a different point of view but with the advent of Artificial Intelligence through devices such as — Alexa, Siri, Google Home and Cortana, this dream is not so far from reality. It is very much possible in present days with a technology popularly known as — </span><strong>Conversational Artificial Intelligence</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let's take a closer look at what Conversational AI is and what its subsidiaries are.</span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>What is Conversational Artificial Intelligence?</strong></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">They are devices or technologies, such as chatbots and voice assistants, that allow humans to communicate with them and do particular activities using voice commands. They are capable of distinguishing between speech and text inputs, as well as translating between languages. They mimic humans in such a way that it gives the user a vibe that they are talking to a real human being! Conversational AI requires huge amounts of data along with machine learning and natural language processing techniques to make human-like interactions a reality.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now we will briefly know about some of the major components of Conversational AI.</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Natural Language — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It consists of sentences, words, letters and characters that vary across many cultures. For instance — English has 26 letters whereas Russian has 33 letters. Important properties of natural language rather than vocabulary are syntax or grammar rules, semantics or meaning and linguistic ontology, i.e, the relationship between words, sentences and phrases. Natural Language often includes words with uncertain and different meanings and even words in different dialects and also errors and a variety of accents. There are words with same pronunciations but have completely different meanings which are known as homophones and words with same spelling or pronunciation but different meanings which are called homonyms.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Voice —</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is a very integral part of Conversational AI as it is the main driving force of the technology. There are Voice User Interfaces in chatbots or voice assistants which allows the users to interact with Conversational AI through their voice. For example — there are voice enabled lights for Google Home which can be switched on or off using commands like — “Ok Google,lights on” or “Ok Google, lights off”. You can also tell Google Home or Amazon Alexa to wake you up in the morning or you can ask it to play your favorite song or even motivational quotes as well.</span></li>
    <li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><strong>Natural Language processing — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a subdomain of artificial intelligence which carries out certain steps which allows machines to understand human language. It uses machine learning, deep learning and some rule-based modeling. It mainly aims to produce appropriate responses by understanding the intent of human language inputs to create a conversation flow which looks natural and human.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It can be subdivided into 3 main parts — Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Natural Language Generation (NLG) and Dialog Management.</span><strong> Natural Language Understanding (NLU) — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It shed light on the intent behind every input. It helps a machine to comprehend spoken or a written language.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Dialog management — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It decodes the intent and classifies it depending on business rules. It keeps the conversation intact with appropriate questions and responses.</span></p>
    <p><strong>Natural Language Generation (NLG) — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It focuses on forming a response which is both accurate and precise. It generates words, phrases and sentences that have contextual meaning and can be comprehended by a human user.</span></p>
    <ol start="4">
    <li><strong> Intent — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is very important for a Conversational AI to understand the intent of a speech or text, as words can contain different meanings depending on the user in different contexts. It must recognize the intent despite the sequencing of the words and the way they are used and must produce an appropriate response.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>A Brief history of NLP — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">To get a concrete idea about Conversational AI, we must know some of the history of NLP and how it evolved into what it is today. I will list down some of the major events of NLP until the year 2020.</span></p>

    <h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a Chatbot?</span></h2>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The word Chatbot was first used in the 1990s. Although the concept and the basic technology has been around since the 1950s. Its earlier version was known as chatterbot. The use of Natural Language Processing in chatbots is a comparatively recent update in the technology. This idea has become more popular through the work of Facebook Messenger, Apple’s Siri, Amazon Echo, Google Home, etc. The previous technique used to build chatbots required several months. Now, with the help of NLP and deep learning, it is possible to build one within only a few hours.</span></p>
    <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We will know take a look into some of the best known and widely used chatbots ever —</span></p>
    <ol>
    <li><strong> Eliza, 1964–1966 —</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It is one of the first natural language processing computer programs developed by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. It was made to show the artificiality of communication between humans and machines. It used pattern matching and substitution methods to give the users an illusion that they are understanding the context of the words.</span></li>
    <li><strong> Cleverbot , 1997–1988 —</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> It was developed by a British AI scientist Rollo Carpenter. It is a chatterbot web application that utilizes AI to start conversing with humans. It uses NLP and fuzzy logic. Fuzzy logic is used to handle a million records stored and used in a heuristic manner. Cleverbot is now trying to implement ML techniques to become more effective.</span></li>
    <li><strong> Mitsuku , 2002 — A </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">web-based chatbot created by Pandorabots and was awarded the annual Loebner Prize in 2013 and 2016 for becoming the most human-like chatbot. It is a virtual friend which can answer questions, play games and do tricks if requested by the user, and it has basic reasoning.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <h2>&nbsp;</h2>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="4">
    <li><strong> Rose, 2011 — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">Brillig Understanding, Inc. built this award-winning chatbot. It's modeled on the characteristics of a teenage girl, and the owner claims to have given the bot its own personality, but it's all based on a code. The key goal for this bot is to be able to express its own feelings and cognitive processes. It is also heavily reliant on pattern matching. It has used a C-style general scripting like language to code it.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="5">
    <li><strong> XIaoice, 2014 — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the AI system developed by</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Microsoft STCA in 2014 based on an emotional computing framework. It has a unique design and works as an AI companion and tries to make an emotional connection. This bot used Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) which optimizes it for long term user engagement.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="6">
    <li><strong> DialoGPT , 2019— </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">Joint production between MSR AI and Microsoft Dynamics 365 AI Research team. It is able to create engaging and natural conversational responses across a variety of topics. It is trained using data collected from 147 million comments done on reddit. The main program is based on hugging face pytorch transformers.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="7">
    <li><strong> Meena, 2020 — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is a chatbot that can sensibly give answers by staying in context of the conversation. This has been termed as google as “neural conversational model”. It was a state of the art system before the recent announcement of Facebook’s Blender and was ahead of the entire race with the highest Sensibleness and Specificity Average (SSA) scores. The main aim of Meena is to address the critical flaw in chatbots of them not making sense.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <ol start="8">
    <li><strong> Blender — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is the facebook’s latest chatbot in collaboration with parlAI and can combine multiple conversational skills at once and for that reason is named as blender. The chatbot is built from upon 9.4 billion parameters and trained using 1.5 billion examples of conversation, making it so huge that it must be split up into pieces in order to tackle larger sets of data.</span></li>
    <li><strong> IBM Watson — </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">IBM Watson has several prebuilt conversational AI applications such as — Watson Natural Understanding for advances text analytics, Watson Speech to Text to transform voice into written text with powerful machine learning technology and also Watson Text to Speech to convert written text into natural-sounding audio in a variety of languages and voices and many other similar applications which are transforming businesses.</span></li>
    </ol>

    title: `How Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Business`,
    content: `<article className="content news__content">
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">In 2020, it's difficult to think of a sector that artificial intelligence (AI) won't disrupt. The technology promises to transform businesses ranging from transportation to telecommunications, while also holding promise for sectors held back by manual processes and legacy technology. Insurance is one such sector.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Insurance is striving to modernize, and AI can help streamline processes within multiple areas, including underwriting and business intelligence. As professionals responsible for taking on commercial risk, underwriters are under pressure to assess applications accurately and with a high level of technical detail. This involves analyzing past decisions and mining extensive application documents for necessary information.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">"A commercial property inspection document may be up to 50 pages long," explains Charles Dugas, an AI expert, who has worked as an actuarial analyst and lectured on actuarial science. "You're trying to sift through these pages in order to retrieve a single piece of information."</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Now, imagine repeating that manual process for each new application. This slows down the underwriting process, which is often a race toward a fast policy decision.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">"Brokers will send the same piece of information to various insurers," says Dugas. "In some cases, they'll choose between the first few quotes that come in, so if you're too slow at processing submissions, you may not get a chance to bid on a piece of business, even though your price might be the best."</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Insurance managers have a separate challenge as they try to keep insurance operations hitting their critical business targets, such as cost per claim, claims ratio, and settlement times. Fast-evolving business and social conditions, such as those we've seen in 2020, can affect these metrics. Because many managers and actuaries frequently work with legacy systems where metrics are not readily available, and accessing and processing them is a manual and time-consuming task, it is only performed so often. As a result, operations risk flying blind as they decide how to allocate staff time and resources based on outdated information.</p>
    <h2 style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">How AI Can Help</h2>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">AI tools, like those offered by Element AI, can help in two essential ways.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">First, Element AI's <a href="https://www.elementai.com/products/document-intelligence">Document Intelligence</a> product is used to accelerate and automate the processing of semi-structured and unstructured documents, such as incoming broker submissions. Additional features, like business identity code identification, auto-declining submissions outside an insurer's risk appetite, and intelligent submission triaging, contribute to dramatically reducing the time spent processing broker submissions. Ultimately, this benefits insurers by enabling faster broker response times and by ensuring underwriters prioritize the most valuable opportunities for the business.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Second, Element AI's <a href="https://www.elementai.com/products/knowledge-scout">Knowledge Scout</a> enables computers to speak like humans, rather than forcing users to learn database query languages like SQL. This enables underwriters and business specialists to ask questions in natural language, just like they would if they were asking a person. For instance, an underwriter can retrieve relevant data by posing simple inquiries, such as, "List all claims related to business activity code 5812 from the past 10 years." Within a matter of seconds, they can find specific information contained in long, detailed documents, like the location of a fireplace as listed in a property inspection document. The benefits of providing easier and more rapid access to information for underwriters are clear: They can make more confident and more consistent underwriting decisions, in addition to unlocking valuable efficiency gains.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Element AI's Knowledge Scout empowers managers to make decisions based on current conditions instead of what they see in the rear-view mirror, adds Dugas. "Managers may face ad hoc questions that crop up," he explains. "What is causing higher accident frequencies? Why are we not closing more business? Why are we seeing poor results in a particular line of business? Now they can ask their questions in natural language and get answers quickly."</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Streamlining the underwriting and management processes yields several critical business benefits for insurers, including faster customer service. Expedited application processing enables insurers to serve broker queries more quickly, potentially cutting submission processing times by up to 55 per cent, according to Element AI's data. Because brokers often award policies on a first-past-the-post basis, reducing these delays also helps insurers beat the competition.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">Furthermore, AI enables underwriters to process submissions more consistently and accurately. They can decide whether to accept a policy and determine pricing based on more comprehensive data. Lastly, by continually harvesting knowledge from new underwriting decisions, AI creates a platform for continuous improvement. An up-to-date knowledge base encompassing the latest applications and decisions gives underwriters immediate and automatic access to all other underwriting decisions in the company.</p>
    <h2 style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">A Step-Change in Functionality</h2>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">AI represents an unprecedented opportunity for insurance companies to improve the way they operate. Most technology developments offer incremental benefits, bettering performance a little at a time. Oftentimes, when productivity software companies introduce document macros and database companies refine their indexing, it doesn't impact business users in meaningful ways. But when a technology enables people to collect and harvest knowledge in entirely new formats, it's transformative.</p>
    <p style="transform: matrix(1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0); visibility: inherit; opacity: 1;" data-show-scroll="visible">AI offers a step-change in business benefits, dramatically boosting business capabilities in measurable ways that can affect the bottom line and make insurers more competitive.</p>
